<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Bread</strong> – a thicker sliced bread such as texas toast works best</li>
    <li><strong>Butter</strong> – use a generous 1/2 Tbsp of butter on each slice of bread. We use unsalted but any butter will work here.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheese</strong>– we use a combination of sliced medium cheddar, gouda and Havarti cheese.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Butter the toast</strong> – spread 1/2 Tbsp butter on one side of each slice of bread. </li>
    <li><strong>Heat Skillet</strong> – place a skillet over low to medium/low heat. A griddle should be at 275˚F. Immediately add 2 slices of bread with the butter-side-down.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Cheese</strong> – stack cheeses on one of the pieces of bread, cover with the other piece of toast and flip the sandwich over.</li>
    <li><strong>Brown the toast</strong> – Continue sauteeing, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese is melted.</li>
    <li><strong>Serve</strong> – cut the sandwich in half on the diagonal to serve.</li>
